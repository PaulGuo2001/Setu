//! Proposer Election Trait
//!
//! This module defines the core trait for leader/proposer election in the Setu consensus.
//! Different election strategies can be implemented by implementing the `ProposerElection` trait.

use std::cmp::Ordering;

/// Validator identifier type
pub type ValidatorId = String;

/// Round number type (logical time or epoch-based round)
pub type Round = u64;

/// Voting power type
pub type VotingPower = u128;

/// ProposerElection incorporates the logic of choosing a leader among multiple candidates.
///
/// In Setu's DAG-based consensus, the leader is responsible for:
/// 1. Monitoring VLC increments to determine when to fold the DAG
/// 2. Creating ConsensusFrames (CF) when the VLC delta reaches the threshold
/// 3. Proposing the CF to other validators for voting
///
/// This trait is designed to be extensible, allowing for different election strategies:
/// - Round-robin rotation (simple, deterministic)
/// - Reputation-based selection (considers historical performance)
/// - Weighted random selection (considers stake/voting power)
